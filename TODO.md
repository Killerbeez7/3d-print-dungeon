## üì± Mobile Breakpoint Audit Checklist

### General Layout
  - [ ] No horizontal scroll at 320px, 375px, or 768px 
  // components to fix at 320px:
  model page
  events home
  forum home

   // components to fix at 375px:
   forum home
   
   // components to fix at 768px:
   forum home


  - [ ] Content fits within the viewport (no clipped text/images)
  - [ ] Padding and margins are comfortable (not too tight or too wide)
  - [ ] No fixed widths that break on small screens

  - [ ] No elements are too close together

### Images & Cards
  - [ ] Images scale down and keep aspect ratio
  - [ ] Cards wrap and fill the space (no overflow)
  - [ ] No fixed heights/widths that break layout

### Grids & Lists
  - [ ] Grids auto-wrap (e.g., use grid-cols-[repeat(auto-fill,minmax(14rem,1fr))])
  - [ ] Lists are readable and not squished

### Modals & Popups
  - [ ] Modals fit the screen and are scrollable if needed
  - [ ] No content is hidden off-screen

### Accessibility
  - [ ] Sufficient color contrast
  - [ ] All images have alt text
  - [ ] Can be navigated with keyboard (tab key)

- [ ] **CV-first roadmap**
  - Focus on visible polish + code quality first; leave deep refactors until you need them.

  üî• **Do in the next 1-2 weeks**
  - [ ] **1. Finish mobile breakpoints**
    - [ ] Audit every page at 320 px / 375 px / 768 px.
    - [ ] Replace fixed h-40, w-[300px], large paddings with aspect-[4/5], max-w-xs, p-2 md:p-4.
    - [ ] Use grid-cols-[repeat(auto-fill,minmax(14rem,1fr))] patterns so cards auto-wrap.
    - [ ] A full design-system refactor (e.g. moving to Tailwind or Chakra) can wait‚Äîsmall CSS utils get you 90% there.
  - [ ] **2. Lazy-load heavy bundles**
    - [ ] Dynamic‚Äêimport <ModelViewer> and Three.js only on the model details page (import(/* webpackChunkName: "viewer" */ '...')).
    - [ ] Add React 18 <Suspense> fallback.
    - [ ] Code splitting the entire app with Route level chunks (Vite PWA plugin) is nice but not urgent.
  - [ ] **3. Add Lighthouse-clean PWA basics**
    - [ ] @vite-pwa/plugin + manifest.webmanifest so the site installs on a phone.
    - [ ] A 192√ó192 and 512√ó512 icon.
    - [ ] Full offline mode (background syncing) is future work.
  - [ ] **4. README + Architecture doc**
    - [ ] Explain "why React-Query over Redux", the Storage resize pipeline, and folder layout. Recruiters love clear docs.
    - [ ] Auto-generated Storybook docs‚Äîgreat later, not critical now.
  - [ ] **5. GitHub Actions CI**
    - [ ] On every push: npm ci && npm run lint && npm run test.
    - [ ] Deploy preview to Firebase Hosting --channel pr-<num>.
    - [ ] End-to-end Cypress tests running in CI‚Äîvaluable, but after the basics are green.
  - [ ] **6. Strong sample data & screenshots**
    - [ ] Populate Firestore with 3-5 "showcase" models and events.
    - [ ] Add gif/videos of upload flow to the repo's README.
    - [ ] Admin dashboard for editing data can wait.
  - [ ] **7. Accessibility pass (a11y)**
    - [ ] npm i -D @axe-core/react, run in dev, fix obvious colour contrast & missing alt.
    - [ ] Full WCAG 2.1 AA audit could be future freelance work.
  - [ ] **8. Unit-test one slice**
    - [ ] Pick modelsService.js; mock Firebase and test upload logic. Shows real-world testing skill in small time.
    - [ ] 100% coverage everywhere is not needed for a portfolio.
  - [ ] **9. Error boundaries & toast feedback**
    - [ ] Wrap routes in <ErrorBoundary>; show a toast on Firestore errors. Polished UX for little code.
